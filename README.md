# Colorful pixels

Colorful pixels is a work-in-progress WebGL 3D library :)

## Why yet another WebGL library?

To be honest, there really is no need to build our own 3D library. There are many of these already out there.
This is actually a project by [Lea](https://github.com/terabaud), and she decided building something like that anyway, just in order to learn how all this works.

## Features

- `Vector`, `Matrix` classes
- a `Renderer` which renders `WebGLObject`s
- a `WebGLObject` contains a geometry, uniforms, vertex and fragment shaders
- Helpers for creating orthographic, perspective projection matrices
- A `Stopwatch` class for timing (like `performance.now()` but with the possibility to start/stop)
- One-Liners (`mix`, `clamp`)
- Basic geometries (plane geometry, box geometry, sphere geometry and a custom geometry)

## Getting started

In this section, I will explain how to get started, when it's ready.
